# config

The `config` package makes it easy to manage environment specific
configuration values. For example, you might want to use distinct values
for development, testing, and production environments.

## Installation

The package is not yet available on PyPI, but you can install it from GitHub:

``` sh
pip install git+https://github.com/andrie/py-config
```

Tip: add this to your `requirements.txt` file:

``` sh
config @ git+https://github.com/andrie/py-config
```

And then use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the package.

## How to use

Given this `config.yaml` file:

``` yaml
default:
  trials: 5
  dataset: "data-sampled.csv"
  
production:
  trials: 30
  dataset: "data.csv"
```

You can read the config file:

``` python
import config.core as config
```

``` python
config.config_get('trials')
```

``` python
config.config_get('trials', 'production')
```
